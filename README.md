New Open-Source CMS page builder that focuses on components rather than themes.

I am creating Puzzle to simplify building pages with reusable components, addressing challenges I’ve encountered in CMS platforms like Magento 2, WordPress, and Drupal. While these systems are powerful, they often make simple tasks complex and require many modules for small websites. Puzzle focuses on being lightweight and intuitive, offering an easier solution.

## Stack

### Backend

* Symfony 7
* Twig
* PHP 8.4
* PHPUnit
* PHPCS
* DDEV

### Frontend

* VueJS 3
* TypeScript
* eslint
* Vite 6
* TailwindCSS 4
* AlpineJS

Components will be able to load content from external APIs or internal data sources. Abstraction between component and
data sources.


The project is a work-in-progress and far from alpha, with rapid daily evolution and potential rewrites of core components as development progresses.
